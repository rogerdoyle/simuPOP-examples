I'm a retired biology professor(genetics, Dalhousie University, in Canada) and currently a consultant focusing on aquaculture and conservation genetics in developing countries.

Two recent papers that are available free on the web: Doyle, R.W., 2016. Inbreeding and disease in tropical shrimp aquaculture: a reappraisal and caution. Aquaculture Research. 47, 21-35; Doyle, R.W., 2014. ‘Big Picture’ Connects Shrimp Disease, Inbreeding. Global Aquaculture Advocate. 17 (Sept/Oct), 45-46.

The objective of this simuPOP simulation project is to find indicators of genetic erosion and other genetic problems in small-holder farms and hatcheries which, mostly for financial reasons, are unable to manage their broodstocks in any of the approved ways. None of the Fisher-Wright assumptions fit the demographies of such populations even approximately, hence the simulation.

The py project file shows how to tag the record of every individual in a simulated evolution with ID, parentage and subpopulation membership along with its genotype. I am greatly indebted to Bo Peng for advice on how to do this.
